# SquadUp

A social network for LFGs in practically any game, written in [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [ReactJS](https://react.dev/).

## Disclaimer

This is not a fully functional system, nor a safe one. It was intended as a final project for CS class during high school, and focuses solely on displaying my ability with PHP and ReactJS for grading purposes.

No PRs or Issues will be considered, as any work I do on the project is solely for "fun" and sake of completionism.

## Plans

While I have no intention to release it to the public as a full webapp, but I will (probably) finish the vast majority of it nonetheless.

### TODOs

- [x] Move to PostgreSQL as DBMS
- [ ] **[IN PROGRESS]** Rewrite backend in ASP.NET core
- [ ] Finish up all frontend features
- [ ] Make it a relatively safe system
